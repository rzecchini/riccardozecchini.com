	Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer very concerned about the fact that the things we design are not so similar to the people who use them.
	<br>My work shifts between information architecture, modular design and human-computer interaction.
	<br>In my spare time I love going climbing and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/picre" target="_blank">exploring the mountains</a>.
