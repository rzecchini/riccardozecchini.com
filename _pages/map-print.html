	<p>The map lists all the workshops and activities and states how much does it take to move from a place/town to another. The first section shows how to move through the territory using public transports or by car. Within there is a detailed map of the city of Urbino, where we can find the traveling times by feet, that is the way of transport which students use the most.</p>
